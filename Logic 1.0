#Logic for the ideation stage

1. Start
2. Invite digital twin of note taker to online meeting (we have to create meeting link  with date and time and create a schedule then at the specified time note taker will hit link.)
3. Participate in online meeting like other members
4. Record the meeting
5. Prepare notes as verbatim(speech to text transcription) and aslo from the presented screen (using image to text) and compare both and make a accurate note.
6. Learn from images or presentation by software like image recognistion to learn more from texts and images shown in the presentation or shared screen. Convert content in image to text.
7. Learn from the graph and data visualsation, and make note from the trend in the graph.
8. Learn from presented videos using object detecton and tone analyser.   
9. Detect important keywords based on agenda
10. Time stamp and speaker recognition has to be done(Time stamp can be achieved by speak diarization, Speech-to-Text can recognize multiple speakers in the same audio clip.)
11. If there is any special notes to be taken more importantly we can use a special assist called upon a keyword (If coffiecient of Relation crossed a certain fixed threshold then it is consider as important keyword as soon as these keyword are detected then it will start recording.
)
12. All the data will be saved in the drive with audio and video clips for future uses
13. After Speech to text  summarization of meeting has to be done
 can be done by taking the text splitting into sentences , removing stop words, and other text preprocessing ,building a similarity matrix, finding their rank and picking top sentences from matrix. 
14. End.
