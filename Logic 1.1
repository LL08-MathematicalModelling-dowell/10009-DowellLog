1. Start
2. Invite digital twin of note taker to online meeting (we have to create meeting link  with date and time and create a schedule then at the specified time note taker will hit link.)
3. Participate in online meeting like other members
4. Record the meeting
5. Prepare notes as verbatim(speech to text transcription)
6. Detect important keywords based on agenda
7. Time stamp and speaker recognition has to be done(Time stamp can be achieved by speak diarization, Speech-to-Text can recognize multiple speakers in the same audio clip.)
8. If there is any special notes to be taken more importantly we can use a special assist called upon a keyword (If coffiecient of Relation crossed a certain fixed threshold then it is consider as important keyword as soon as these keyword are detected then it will start recording.
)
9. All the data will be saved in the drive with audio and video clips for future uses
10. After Speech to text  summarization of meeting has to be done
 can be done by taking the text splitting into sentences ,removing stop words, and other text preprocessing ,building a similarity matrix, finding their rank and picking top sentences from matrix. 
11. End.


ideation:-
During the meeting if notetaker detect that screen is being shared or any thing is being presented then it automatically switches to video recording and screenshot of screen.
If during speech to text conversion during online meeting if it failed to convert then it can be corrected by raising an error or asking doubt to attendee(such as i didn't understand ,can you repeat this) .This way we can create interactive notemaker who can rectify itself based on live feedback
We can also train our model to react to specific words such as (marked it as very important, highlight the last line) this way we can make more engaging and defined summary(voice assistant) to get mannual control as well.
we can also use notetaker to summarize and analyze prerecorded or live videos and audios on any platform(youtube,educational platform etc) .
We can train our model to perform intent analysis on speeches by politician ,industrialist and others to summarize the intent behind the speech.
We can train our model to perform sentiment analysis to get sentiment(positive or negative) of meeting (For busisness purposes for e.g. client satisfaction during a meeting).
During Speech-to-Text, you can provide a list of additional languages that the audio data might include If you include a list of languages in your request, Speech-to-Text attempts to transcribe the audio based upon the language that best fits the sample from the alternates you provide Speech-to-Text then labels the transcription results with the predicted language code this way notetaker can deal with multiple languages during meeting.
We can train our model to convert images or screenshot into text(for summary) during online meeting. This can be done by various text extraction from image methods(such as OCR ).
